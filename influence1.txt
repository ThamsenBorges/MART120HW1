My parents definately influenced me to be a nice person they would always give me and my sister what we wanted to the best of their ability to keep us happy. I've learned a lot from them on just how to be a good person and im thankful for that. Playing online games in my early teens namely call of duty made me a tougher person, those lobbies were so toxic and just full of people making fun of eachother and yelling you had to grow some thick skin to survive in there. I have had some bad relationships over the past couple years that have made me more secluded I suppose and less likely to keep trying for more. My mom has always been the supportive one and always helping me whenever she can, shes tought me to lend a helping hand when you can. My dad was more of the "do it yourself" type and pushing me to do better things, hes the reason im even typing this right now. Im glad I have them.
